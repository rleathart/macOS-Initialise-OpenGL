# Summary

I wasn't able to find any guides that showed the bare minimum necessary to
create an OpenGL window using only native APIs. This repository is providing
just that!

You don't need XCode and you don't need to faff around with `Info.plist` or
`.nib` files. Just write the code to render your program and you're done!
